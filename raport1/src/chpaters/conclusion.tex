In conclusion, in this report we presented the Blockchain technical details, what is Blockchain, how does this protocol works and what makes it so powerful and we determine the fields that could be improved by the adoption of Blockchain. The number of processes that can make use of this technology is large and the impact of Blockchain is massive.
From financial applications to identity management, land title registration or crowd funding, the Blockchain is going to revolutionize everything we knew and complained about.

The Decision Support System aims to offer clear architectural solutions for improving old and unreliable systems. The DSS is going to collect all the project specifications and it will create solutions that are Blockchain based and meet the old system requirements. The DSS uses logical design model of successful Blockchain based systems from the same field. The limitation of the DSS is that it can be used only for fields well described by logical models.

Taking into account all the fields that can be innovated using Blockchain technology, the project of developing a Decision Support System for assisting managers in innovating their product with the power of Blockchain is going to be a successful idea.
