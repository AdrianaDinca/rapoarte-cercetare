This thesis presents the \textbf{\project}.
This is an example of a footnote \footnote{\url{www.google.com}}. 
You can see here a reference to \labelindexref{Section}{sub-sec:proj-objectives}.

Here we have defined the CS abbreviation.\abbrev{CS}{Computer Science} and the UPB abbreviation.\abbrev{UPB}{University Politehnica of Bucharest}

We have now included \labelindexref{Figure}{img:report-framework}.

\fig[scale=0.5]{src/img/reporting-framework.pdf}{img:report-framework}{Reporting Framework}

We can also have citations like \cite{iso-odf}.
We are now discussing the \textbf{Ultimate answer to all knowledge}.
This line is particularly important it also adds an index entry for \textit{Ultimate answer to all knowledge}.\index{Ultimate answer to all knowledge}



We can also include listings like the following:

% Inline Listing example
\lstset{language=make,caption=Application Makefile,label=lst:app-make}
\begin{lstlisting}
CSRCS = app.c
SRC_DIR =..
include $(SRC_DIR)/config/application.cfg
\end{lstlisting}

Listings can also be referenced. References don't have to include chapter/table/figure numbers... so we can have hyperlinks \labelref{like this}{lst:makefile-test}.

\subsection{Tables}

We can also have tables... like \labelindexref{Table}{table:reports}.

\begin{center}
	\begin{table}[htb]
		\caption{Generated reports - associated Makefile targets and scripts}
		\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
			Generated report & Makefile target & Script \\
			\hline
			Full Test Specification & full_spec & generate_all_spec.py  \\
			Test Report & test_report & generate_report.py  \\
			Requirements Coverage & requirements_coverage &
			generate_requirements_coverage.py   \\
			API Coverage & api_coverage & generate_api_coverage.py  \\
		\end{tabular}
		\label{table:reports}
	\end{table}
\end{center}
