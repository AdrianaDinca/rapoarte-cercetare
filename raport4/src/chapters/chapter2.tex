\section{Hyperledger Project}
\label{sub-sec:chapter1-section1}
Hyperledger is a open source project focused on Blockchain technology that aims to bring IoT, supply chain, finance, banking and manufacturing together. Is is hosted by the Linux Foundation and includes leaders from all the mentioned areas.

The Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed network, each participant of the network has its own copy of the ledger, and any transaction is validated by the majority of participants. The validation is done by solving Byzantine Generals Problem via consensus.
The Hyperledger project offers solutions based on Blockchain and adds the possibility of creating \emph{smart contracts} and has a large number of assistive tools to facilitate the embrace of Blockchain.
All projects developed under the umbrella of Hyperledger and Linux Foundation are applications that use a ledger of transactions to establish transparency, accountability and trust. These projects are for a wide variety of business areas by providing the infrastructure, tools and frameworks to build applications based on Blockchain easily and in a short period of time. Additionally these applications follow the legal constrains by keeping the network closed to authorized participants that can be made accountable for their actions.

The project was launched in 2016 under the guidance of many important corporations such as IBM, Intel, etc. The first codebases that were released to the public were Hyperledger Fabric - a product that was the work result of three organizations (OpenBlockchain from IBM, libconsensus from Blockstream and the smart contracts from Digital Asset) and Hyperledger Sawtooth from Intel. 
These two frameworks were offering support for growing the development of Blockchain business solutions. Later on, there were other projects released that continued to offer assistive tools to support this growth. All projects that were released under the Hyperledger project were supervised by the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee, a group of eleven specialists that were elected from the technical contributor community.
In May 2016 the Linux Foundation and the corporate members involved in Hyperledger project elected an Executive Director to make sure that this idea has all the resources needed to be successful. In this position was placed the co-founder of Apache Software Foundation - Brian Behlendorf. 
The project became so successful so at the end of the next year the Hyperledger counted seven more projects and the number of members increased to more that 200.

The most successful projects were Hyperledger Sawtooth - multi-language support for distributed ledger, Hyperledger Fabric - the distributed ledger written in GO language, Hyperledger Composer - framework for accelerating the process of developing Blockchain applications, Hyperledger Iroha - the distributed ledger written in C++ and Hyperledger Indy - distributed ledger for decentralized identities.
All these frameworks and tools are used in real-life applications except for Hyperledger Composer which is still in incubation. The Hyperledger Composer is an assistive tool for developers to facilitate the process of building a business network using the Hyperledger Fabric. 
It was proven that Hyperledger Composer is hard to maintain so the Hyperledger board decided to stop the development of new features and to keep the existing functionalities compatible with the new versions of Hyperledger Fabric.
The main focus of the community is to add more features to Hyperledger Fabric framework which has a modular architecture so adding new features can be done quickly and without affecting the pre-existent functionalities.

In the following sections we are going to describe the Hyperledger Fabric and Composer frameworks. The Blockchain technology promises a revolution as big as the Web and the Hyperledger group understood its potential so they formed a Blockchain incubator to offer support to any bright idea related with Blockchain technology, smart contracts and the business world.

\section{Hyperledger Fabric}
\label{sub-sec:chapter1-section2}

\subsection{General aspects}
\label{sub-sec:chapter1-subsection1}

Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of a distributed ledger developed mostly in Golang. The framework uses also other languages and technologies such as Javascript, Go or Java for smart contracts (chaincode), SDK in Node.js, Python, Java, Go and Rest.
It is a solution for a secure, high-performance and permissioned Blockchain based network that has a modular architecture that allows plugins for any new features with no impact on the core functionalities.

Before getting into more details about the features provided by this framework it is important to mention that it is developed for enterprise use cases so the solution must solve the identity issue for transaction of type know-your-customer or the money laundering issue by offering transparency to authorities as participants with advanced permissions in the network. Thus this framework is permissioned which means that the participants are not anonymous, their identity is known by the other participants so they can be made accountable for their actions. The framework network is private and the transaction content is confidential so it can contain business sensitive information.

More than that the framework offers the  possibility of selecting a consensus protocol based on the business needs. For example, if the business network is used by a single enterprise or it is governed by a authorized identity there's no need for using the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol so it may sufficient to go with a simplified version such as Crash Fault Tolerant (CFT) consensus protocol. As a result, the Hyperledger Fabric eliminates the low latency of transaction validation and  improves the network performance. The framework doesn't required CPU power for mining or for smart contract execution so the cost is similar with any distributed system.

The Hyperledger Fabric has a wide community of developers and activists that help with the development and maintaining of Fabric codebase. The number of contributors has grown to more than 200 members and the organizations involved to 35 so the project benefits of a diverse set of skills. With such a support the future of this project is really promising. It has modular and pluggable architecture so it can bring innovation to many industries.

\subsection{Technical aspects}
\label{sub-sec:chapter1-subsection2}

Modularity is one of the main characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric. It was
designed to have a modular architecture so it can be used by a large number of industries from manufacturing to finance. 

The project was designed to be modular so all the components can be plugged in/out. The list of components is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item an \emph{ordering service} that makes sure that the order of transaction is correct and that the all peers receives the blocks of transactions via broadcast; the ordering services can be plugged in/out and it runs in an independent environment (e.g Docker container named \emph{hyperledger/fabric-orderer});
	\item a \emph{membership service provider} that enables only authorized entities to take part in the network(e.g a Docker container named \emph{hyperledger/fabric-ca}); any entity that wants to connect to the business network has to have a cryptographic identity created by the business network Certification Authority (CA);
	\item \emph{smart contracts} are applications that run independently in docker containers or other isolated environments and store agreements between network members; these smart contracts are named \emph{chaincode} and they can be written in almost any programming language;
	\item a variety of \emph{DBMS} options to store the ledger; a common option is CouchDB that runs in a Docker container named \emph{hyperledger/fabric-couchdb};
	\item more application's constrains for approval and validation policy;
	\item an optional \emph{peer-to-peer gossip service} to leverage messages to all the peers by broadcast; makes sure that everyone receives up-to-date information about the ledger transactions and fills in any gaps if one node missed some of the broadcasts.	
\end{itemize}

The chaincode (smart contract) is an application that facilitates and verifies the execution of a digital agreement between one or more network participants. The ledger is responsible for executing the digital contract at the time that it need to be applied. In a business network one or more digital contracts can co-exist and everyone that is connected to that network can create a contract. The network is responsible for validating that application code and it should be consider invalid until it is validated using order-execute architecture. In most blockchain systems the smart contracts follow the rule order-execute so to reach consensus the order-execute design should be deterministic. Building a deterministic architecture  is quite challenging and the code should be written in domain-specific programming languages (e.g Ethereum developed a DSL - Solidity for their decentralized applications) in most of the cases.
Additionally this architecture brings performance issues due to the fact that transactions are added sequentially in the ledger.

The Hyperledger Fabric tries to solve the overhead of using the order-execute approach by proposing a new architecture type - execute-order-validate. This new design is composed by three stages. In the first stage the transactions are checked for correctness and if so they are immediately executed. After that, they are ordered using a consensus protocol and in the last stage they are validated according to an endorsement policy and added to the ledger. As a result of this approach the Hyperledger Fabric solves the issue of using DSL and non-determinism by removing any inconsistency and reduces the performace overhead. By removing any non-deterministic problem, the smart contracts can be written in any standard programming language. The first supported languages are Go and Node.js but the board of Hyperledger plans to support more popular programming languages such as Java in the future releases.

Permissioned blockchain refers to restricting the access to the network to a known group of participants that are worth it to be trusted. It is not necessary that participants may know each other but all of them should be vetted by a trustful authority. The Fabric is using a permissioned blockchain system so each member of the business network can easily be identified and if his/her actions (e.g deploying a smart contract or changing the configuration of the network) are malicious that member can be made accountable and pay for them. In a permissionless blockchain system it is very hard to identify the real person that stood behind a certain action so Hyperledger Fabric is more suitable for business. The Certification Authority is one instrument that can vet for the business network members and any respectful business can easily obtain the authorization to participate in the network.

MAY CONTAIN COPY-PASTE IDEAS
NOT USE IN FINAL THESIS
The Hyperledger consortium has many different projects that focus on different aspects of how ledgers can work and what use cases they can be applied for.

Hyperledger Composer has created a modelling language that allows you to define the assets, participants, and transactions that make up your business network using business vocabulary. In addition, the transaction logic is then written by developers using Javascript. This simple interface allows business people and technologists to work together on defining their business network.
The framework main goal was to reduce time and accelerate the Blockchain adoption and to make it easier to integrate business systems with the Blockchain.

The Hyperledger Composer is using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain infrastructure and runtime that has pluggable blockchain consensus protocols to validate transactions  accordingly with the participants policy.

This framework is using a business network model to quickly model the business by defining the assets, participants and the transactions. The framework provides with some sample of business network or require the users to deploy their network models.
The business network model is an archive that contains a list of files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Model file .cto} - assets, participants and transactions
	\item \emph{Script File .js} - transactions functions
	\item \emph{Access Control .acl} - access control rules
	\item \emph{Query File .qry} - query definitions
\end{itemize}
All this files are stored in a business network archive that has the extension \emph{.bna}.
The Business Network Archive \emph{.bna} is deployed in one of the distributed ledger Hyperledger solution such as Hyperledger Fabric Cloud or Local or in a simulated online environment (web browser/ node.js). See \labelindexref{Figure}{img:BNAStructure} for a better description of the \emph{.bna} file. 

\fig[scale=0.3]{src/img/BNAStructure.png}{img:BNAStructure}{Business Network Archive Structure(source \cite{bnaStructure})} 

Hyperledger Composer provides a suite of tools for building blockchain business networks. These tools allow you to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Editors for modeling your business blockchain network
	\item Generate REST APIs for interacting with your blockchain network
	\item Generate a skeleton Angular application.
\end{itemize}

Built in Javascript, Hyperledger Composer provides an easy-to-use set of components that developers can quickly learn and implement. The project was contributed by Oxchains and IBM.

The benefits of Hyperledger Composer are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Faster creation of blockchain applications}, eliminating the massive effort required to build blockchain applications from scratch
	\item \textbf{Reduced risk} with well-tested, efficient design that aligns understanding across business and technical analysts
	\item \textbf{Greater flexibility} as the higher-level abstractions make it far simpler to iterate.
\end{itemize}
