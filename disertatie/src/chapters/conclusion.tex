In conclusion, we created a proof-of-concept to solve the issues identified in tha CAPEX procedures conducted by the Network Visibility Solution department of Ixia Solutions Group using two business oriented Blockchain based projects: Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric. The main motivation for this application is to outline the diversity of advantages the Blockchain protocol offers for the business world. In addition, we have explored some powerful solutions that facilitate the adoption of this technology. The two frameworks developed by the Hyperledger organization are programmer-friendly so anyone with some basic programming skills can manage to develop a Blockchain based application in a few months. In the future, we plan to generate the API for this business network and a basic web client to complete the Hardware Supply-Chain user experience.
