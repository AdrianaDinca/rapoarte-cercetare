Naming and identity services are widely used concept implemented in multiple technologies. These systems should have three basic attributes: secure, descentralized and human-meaningful.
Traditional technologies perform well but none of them provide all three properties. The Namecoin system claims to fulfill all three attributes by building a distributed network but it is quite young, the documentation is sparse and there are unexplored features. The protocol is developed and used by a small community, thus it lacks maturity and is unexplored enough.

We propose an exploring solution for filling the existing gaps.
There is no tool available for discovering Namecoin's naming services so we build a prototype for exploring the Namecoin's domain name specifications. As a result of our exploration, we validate protocol technical implementation details. 
Our evaluation outlines that only a small group of Namecoin name owners offer contact information such as email, IP or websites. The majority of owners are using privacy-preserving messaging protocols for communication thus the Namecoin protocol is quite popular among users with high privacy requirements.
